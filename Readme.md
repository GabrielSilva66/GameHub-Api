## Project Overview

The GameHub API was developed to help users manage their game collections and make smarter purchasing decisions. It allows users to organize games into purchased and wish-listed categories, track price histories, and compare prices from various online stores. The API also calculates the lowest price for each game and provides useful analytics, such as filtering completed games by category or publisher.

This solution centralizes game data, making it easier for users to track their collections and compare offers from different stores in real time.
